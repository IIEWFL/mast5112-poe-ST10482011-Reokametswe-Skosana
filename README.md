The changes that i have made in phase 3:

-i added the chef panel, where the chef can change the menu, where the chef can either add a menu for the specic week or day, and even delete it, the chef side of the add also allows the chef so update cutsomers on the status of the food preperation, the chef panel is also the side where the chef can see all the orders.
-the customer side of the app has features where you can scroll dowm to see more items in the menu, and a search bar, add to cart screen and add to cart/order buttons, the app allows the user to see the subtotal, and how much all the items add up, a screen where the customer can remove/delete items then confirm the order when they are sure of their order, or when they are done ordering, the orders are then visible in the chef panel.
- added consistent add scheme throughout the mobile application,added easy navigation and functionaltiy to the app
